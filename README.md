# Python Jpeg Finder

An application written in Python that allows you to see what JPEG files are located in a given folder. It then prints a list of all the 
JPEG formatted images. This uses the OS module and the Glob module. 

There are only 3 jpegs in the given folder so there will be logic applied to sort them out.
